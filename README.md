# 📰 Meta Newsroom Clone

A pixel-focused **front-end clone of the Meta Newsroom website**, built to strengthen my fundamentals in **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** before moving on to **React-based development**.

This project was intentionally created **without any frameworks or libraries** to deeply understand layout structuring, asset handling, responsiveness, and real-world UI complexity.
